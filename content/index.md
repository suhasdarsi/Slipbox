title: Hi! I'm Suhas Darsi

I'm the co-founder of [PureML](https://pureml.com/). This is a collection of thoughts and scribbles to refer to later. I will also record any interesting products I find and what I think are some features that I love; what is the friction that is keeping me away from these products?

I use the Zettlekastian method for my notes, and you might notice that notes are small for the same reason.
